  je_springtime_of_iberia: "The Springtime of Iberia"
    je_springtime_of_iberia_reason: "Republicanism, long suppressed within the borders of Britannia, has entered a period of extensive development. Nowhere is this more evident than in Toledo, aligning with the vision of Waldora Freight, in stark contrast to the more archaic forms of government dominating the region. With sufficient military strength and conflict between all involved powers, many of its theorists that it will be possible for this young state to sieze control of the entire peninsula and upend the existing political order.\n\nWe will be able to, provided neither of us are involved in a diplomatic play or war, demand that another Iberian successor reform their government along radical lines and become a co-governance of ours. Should they refuse, we will invade them to forcefully impose republicanism upon them instead."

      westland_events.10.d: "The Toledo Republic has requested that we become a radical co-governance of theirs."
      westland_events.10.f: "The Toledo Republic, in continuance of its aim of radical takeover of Iberia, has demanded that we reorganize our state into a republican form of government, and become a co-governance of theirs. It is worth noting that their final goal for Iberia is to reorganize the order of the peninsula completely, which may result in the dissolution of all currently existing states, collaboratory or not."
      westland_events.10.a: "They must be foolish to assume we will accept."

      westland_events.11.f: "After a prolonged struggle, we have succeeded in either securing the cooperation or subjugation of all other powers in Iberia. Now, we can begin our next step: organizing the peninsula into a stable order that may act as a radical base to spread republicanism across all of Europe. We will establish a series of co-governances roughly arranged along cultural lines, surrounding a central republic based in Toledo."
      westland_events.11.a: "A toast to the people of Iberia!"
  je_bastion_of_iberia: "The Bastion of Iberia"
    je_bastion_of_iberia_reason: "Joel Freight has always disliked instability. He does not like the feeling of not knowing what the next day would bring; that was why he craved the comfort of Britannia. For the longest time, he has lived a peaceful, unchanging life. All that has vanished with the collapse of Britannia. Once again, he finds himself thrust into a frightening, tumultous world, where everything he has worked towards over the past decades could come crashing down at a moment's notice. Will he be able to find stability again, in Iberia at least?"

      westland_events.40.f: "It had taken time, but Iberia had been restored to stability at last. The squabbling states representing various interests only existed to bring turmoil, turmoil that Joel Freight had put an end to. He sat at the table and accepted another glass of wine, which he savored as he pressed it to his lips. There was finally no more need to worry; no more need at all. He thought that later he would relax on his lavish bed and enjoy the view of the city at night outside his floor-to-ceiling window; he had certainly earned it."
      westland_events.40.a: "It's all come to an end."
  je_restoration_of_portugal: "The Restoration of Portugal"
    je_restoration_of_portugal_reason: "Although old Portugal has not existed for quite some time, the remnants of the old nobility persisted in the abomination that was Westland. With its collapse, they have come out of the shadows, manipulating the young and weak-willed Joel Freight 'Grape Teeth' to their own ends. With a successor of Waldre as figurehead, it is quite possible that they may restore Portugal's former borders; perhaps they will even achieve more..."

      westland_events.30.f: "After the tumult of Westland, and then the turmoil within Iberia itself, the region has been transformed to an order resembling the previous one, with one minor exception. Portugal now stands as the dominant power, with Spain a mere junior partner in a personal union. Joel 'Grape Teeth' Freight stands as its ruler, currently, yet even that stands to change. Maybe soon this figurehead can be replaced by someone with closer ties to... old blood."

He relishes in suffering, in torment, which has been quite a headache for the ruling of Andalusia. There may be some way to lessen his impact on the nation's governance, but in the meantime great care must be taken to ensure things do not blow over.\n\nWe will work to gradually remove Waldro from governance, but we must also keep him happy in the meantime by allowing him to fulfill his sadistic urges. Care must be taken to not allow radicalism to grow too strong, though..."

He was giddy, delighted even.\n"Are you happy with this specimen we've found for you?" one of his guards asked nervously, not wanting to trigger the anger of the ruler of Andalusia.\n\n"Reasonably", he said, already taking delight in the things he'd do to this hapless soul."

With how long he had been running around destroying towns and torturing innocent civilians, people thought that he'd have to be invincible, beyond reprecussions. Evidently, that was no longer the case. Rumors flew, that in his frenzy, he had thrown some sort of tantrum within the capital. Perhaps he'd fallen off the stairs and broken his neck, or perhaps some desperate action had been taken to prevent the madman from running the country any further into the ground.\nWhatever the case, an era had ended."
