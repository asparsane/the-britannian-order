A massive riot in the capital broke out following heated arguments between politicians debating whether or not to continue existence under Britannian protection, eventually leading to a break-in of the imperial palace, despite the presence of armed guards. The military was deployed, but by the time they were able to gun down most of the rioteers, Kaiser [SCOPE.sCharacter('ruler_scope').GetFullName] had been killed, seemingly with a gunshot wound, throwing the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] State into chaos."

  bormann_events.1.t: "Shooting Star"
    bormann_events.1.d: "A formerly unknown politician has rocketed into power following the death of our former Kaiser"
    bormann_events.1.f: "Bormann had already spent the better part of an hour chuckling to himself, at times erupting into full-blown laughter until he doubled over, out of breath. It had been so easy; he'd used the 'ability' granted to him only twice. The first to enter the throne room, and then before anyone could see his face, a second time to walk behind the Kaiser's throne with a loaded gun amid sleeping slaves. When this second trace ended it was trivial to pull the trigger.\nThere was a girl with him in the room, with flowing white hair, round glasses, and a black hat from an era that did not yet belong to this world. She decided to make it abundantly clear that she was growing tired of his antics.\n "You seem quite satisfied with your new toy," she said, expressing some amusement. "Does it satisfy you, Schnitzel? Is this what you wanted from me?"\nBormann's laughing fits finally died down. Licking his lips in amusement, he looked back at her and said, "that's right, H.H. I've found this to be quite useful. Quite convenient that mysterious documents point to me being a heir to the German throne."\nH.H sighed. "Everything moves according to plan. Schnitzel, I trust that you will not forget about our contract...""
    bormann_events.1.a: "Nothing will get in the way."

    bormann_events.2.d: "Prominent Politician [SCOPE.sCharacter('opposer_leader').GetFullName] has been found dead."
    bormann_events.2.f: ""I just wanted to know why the hell you did it," H.H said to him, seething. "Schnitzel Bormann, you've thrown a wrench in everything! Do you know how far you've set yourself back?"\nBormann shrugged. "You said I had to aggressively take control of politics, and that's what I did. He didn't like some stupid policy I'd forced through, and so I got rid of him. Is that such a bad thing? Even if they tried to depose me their combined power would be no match for Kaiser Crimson."\n"You got lucky this time. Maybe someone will see you the next time you pull this kind of stunt. You promise to be more careful to me, now. You wouldn't want to fail your end of the contract, would you?"\nBormann relented and gave his promise."
    bormann_events.2.a: "Bormann will not be opposed!"

  bormann_events.3.t: "The Architect of Germania"
    bormann_events.3.d: "The Kaiser has hired a previously unknown architect to construct his vision for the revamped capital of Germania."
    bormann_events.3.f: ""So as I was saying, I figured that Berlin as it is is pretty old. There's lots of decrepit structures and such, and it's just not the sort of thing people are looking up to in the modern era."\n"H.H, none of that explains why you hired a DENTIST to build our new capital!"\nH.H sighed in the tone mothers use before calmly explaining facts of life to their children, and then said, "listen, Dentist Speer is a very trustworthy man. He's never designed a building in his life, sure, but I see his vision. This is the man we need for a World Capital Germania!"\n"Y-you don't even know his real name!" Bormann shot back accusingly. "There's no way in hell his real first name is dentist! That's s-stupid!"\n"You ought not to judge someone based on their name if they're proper aryans, but that's an issue for later. Schnitzel, you must understand that Dentist Speer is not going anywhere. I've made up my decision, alright?"\Bormann sighed heavily. "Alright. But I'll have to see this Speer character later.""

  bormann_events.4.t: "Construction of a Capital"
    bormann_events.4.d: "Construction of the improved World Capital Germania has begun."
    bormann_events.4.f: "Bormann looked the architect over again and again. The man was tall, muscular, and hansome, with a chiseled build. Bormann did not like him very much.\nSpeer, ignoring the most powerful man in Germany scrutinizing him, continued to look at himself in his handheld mirror. He pressed a finger to his lips and turned his head to one side slowly, admiring his jawline.\nBormann did not like this display of disrespect to the Kaiser, and he made this abundantly clear.\n"Show some respect!" He snapped to the imperial architect at last, who had seemingly not noticed him this entire time. "You're nothing. I could kill you in an instant. You ought to keep that in mind!"\nSpeer was slightly uncomfortable, but replied, "Hey man, that's like sick and whatever, but I'm gonna build Germania, man. Like, H.H is really down with this and everything. With, y'know, making this city a bit groovier and everything?"\nBormann growled.\nSpeer got the message and backed off. "Woah, woah, buddy. Listen man, I got nothing against you. Just chill out, dude. Tell you what, I'll put a big statue of you in the middle of the city and plate in gold. How about that, man?"\nBormann nodded slowly, releasing his clenched fists."

It is protesting our reign; it is attempting to wrest away from us what we deserve."\nBormann shivered and then spat on the floor. "That's ridiculous! That's something completely outlandish. It's- it's nonsense, plain and simple!"\n"Then you would rather believe this happened to our Germany completely organically? Don't be childish, Schniztel. We are being watched, perhaps at this very moment. We are operating under an entity that doesn't take kindly to our goals."\nBormann bit his lip. "Suppose that's true. What are we supposed to do? What do we do against something like that?"\n"This is a test. We're powerless against this "spirit", but it's equally powerless against us. It cannot hurt us; it must be difficult for it to get rid of us. Whatever change it attempts to make to our grand German State, we will revert it, and it will be powerless.

I'll do it of course; it's just... uh... alright.\n"Thank you thank you thank you," she said, jerking him back and forth until he was dizzy.\nBormann winced and forced a smile, brushing his shirt. "I'll send him a diplomatic request right now. Um, I was wondering if you could come with me for a bit. We have been pretty..."\nNot nooow, Schnitzel. I told Dentist I'd meet up with him later today in the Germania Grand Hotel. You want me to be happy, right, Schnitzel?"\nSchniztel gritted his teeth and clenched his fists, turning away from her.

"Yes, it was wonderful working with you and all, Schnitzel, but I've always wanted this, and besides Dentist is such a charming architect, you understand?"\n"I---" Bormann began, but was quickly cut off.\n"Listen, Schnitzel, you're a good boy, aren't you? You'll stay put here and you'll like it. I'll remember to send you postcards. Dentist!"\nDentist Speer appeared, several bags in tow.\nBormann said, "just a second! Aren't those the bags we use to store all of our national treasures?"\nH.H yawned as Speer picked up her and the bags, then said to him, "Yes, yes, yes. There's not much furnishing in Burgundy is what I'm getting at, and it's not as if they're needed here in any case."\nBormann waited until they were safely out of earshot before sobbing into his hands and stamping his foot on the ground in rage.\n"I HATE YOU, DENTIST SPEER!"

He felt rage, even stronger than the ambient rage he felt on a daily basis.\n"With all due respect, your majesty, I believe the situation in Germany for its workers should be improved. After all, we are the backbone of the economy, and we---"\nBormann gritted his teeth and buried his face in his hands. To be frank, he did not want to listen to any of what this man had to say. He didn't have to, anyways. He would make it clear how he felt.\n"SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!" he screamed at the terrified man, as he abruptly stood up from his throne. "I HATE YOU USELESS MAGGOTS! THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL ARE! YOU STUPID BLEEDING HEARTS! WHO CARES? WHO THE HELL CARES? ALL YOU WORTHLESS SCUM SHOULD BOW DOWN TO ME! I'M YOUR EMPEROR! KAISER CRIMSON!"\n Bormann suppressed his urge to instantly kill the man as the world fell away into a hue of red. Only the union rep was there, backing away from the throne, going through his unconscious motions like a machine. Bormann strode past him, pulled out his pistol, hesitated, and threw the thing to the floor.\nThe man blinked twice when the world came back into place. He was stunned. He had moved backwards several steps, seemingly in an instant. Bormann's lips twisted into a cruel smile.\nThe union rep's face contorted into pain as he looked down in horror at the bloody fist protruding through his chest. Bormann jerked his fist back, and left the man bleeding on the ground. Then he began to savagely beat him.\n"THAT'S WHAT YOU GET! YOU SCUM! I'M THE ONE TO BE OBEYED!

"It seems you don't understand how things work in Germania.".\n"No, no, I understand just fine," he said, swallowing, slowly backing away.\n"No, you don't. There are two kinds of people in Germania, the masters and the slaves. I'm the master, do you hear? I'm stronger than all the rest of you. You're all worthless insects. If you're against me I'll just toss you away like trash. Because that's what you are, TRASH!"\n"Your Majesty, calm down. I--"\n"CALM DOWN? YOU'RE TELLING ME TO CALM DOWN?" Bormann shouted at him. "I'M TELLING YOU I'LL MURDER THE WHOLE LOT OF YOU! YOU BLEEDING HEARTS, CARING ABOUT THAT KIND OF SCUM, YOU'RE JUST AS WORTHLESS AS THEM!
