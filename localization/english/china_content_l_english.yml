        FGT_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Fengtian Republic was born from the ill-fated Qing modernization program, the entirety of its results withdrawn to icy manchuria shortly before the collapse of the entire empire. Today, it is ruled uneasily by a republican coalition. With an era of state-guided economic growth drawing to an inevitable close, will republican ideals or the harsh reality of material interest rule over the last hope for a free China?"
        CFD_FLAVOR_TEXT: 0 "The Chinese Federation was created to manage the vast territories of central China following Britannian conquest. Today, the powerless government is divided between moderate reformists and the interests of the landed class. Will the Federation's attempts at modernization succeed in transforming it into the centerpiece of the Britannian Empire?"
