  HNE: "Holy New England"
    HNE_ADJ: "New England"
    HNE_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "New England has remained a stable bastion of purity in the Americas, since the merger during the unrest during Britannia's European conquests. Yet New England held, and the church held. Today the Puritan Church maintains its stranglehold on New England society, even as its control on the minds of the masses slips further and further. With Quakers and their great wealth acting as a destabilizing force towards church authority despite their minority status, the only things maintaining the stability of New England are... hopes and prayers."

    CRM_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Cromwellia, the rich southern lands of Area Far-Westland, is deeply in turmoil beneath its tranquil exterior. As an ever-greater amount of slaves are imported to the colony to maintain its plantation economy, contradictions between master and slave have only sharpened, and many believe a breaking point will soon be reached. The demands for colonial products will only grow as Britannia's prosperity continues, yet a prosperous future for Cromwellia seems increasingly far away."
