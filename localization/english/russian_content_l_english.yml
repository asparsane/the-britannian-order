Yet it is home to a strong people embodying the desire to break free of the chains of poverty tying them to this broken land. The eradication of poverty will not be quick, or cheap, and only a persistent effort will yield any sort of result."

            russia.111.f: "Since the defeat of Russia at the hands of the Britannians, the Far Eastern republic has been in shambles economically, so to speak.

            russia.120.d: "Siberia has been unified under the banner of the Far Eastern Republic; the Siberian United Republic has been proclaimed."
            russia.120.f: "A sea of people flooded the square, to the point the presidental procession could hardly forge a path to the waving banner that now hung from its center. The scattered intellectuals congratulated another, in tears, for the empirical verification of the Republican Experiment, even when they knew there were yet few who could grasp the weight of its meaning.\nThe aged stone buildings to both sides trembled as the flag began its ascent under the afternoon sun, tremors from the roaring crowd rattling their ancient foundations. How many of them had been built when there was still one Russia its children answered to?\nAnd what of the children in the square, who could not comprehend the gravity of the history they were witnessing? Most of them had been born post-invasion, no doubt. For how many of them was 'Russia' a fiery whisper that ignited flames in their hearts yet too tender to know the price paid in blood for this victory?\nMaybe ten, twenty, thirty years from now they would remember the faces of the young soldiers who paraded past them, whom the battlefield had never left. Half of them would be dead in another few campaigns to the west, and precious few would be alive when Russia was ruled under a single banner again. The older ones had a faint understanding of this; the children of Russia would not forget their fathers."
            russia.120.a: "We are born in fire, and to fire we return."
        russia.121.t: "On the Siberian Free Territory"
            russia.121.d: "Our forces have gained suffient power projection as to be able to establish order over the 'Siberian Free Territory'"
            russia.121.f: "Northern Siberia collapsed into dissaray following the Russian Empire's dissolution. The Siberian Free Territory is really a loose amalgation of burnt villages in total dissaray, and now we are finally able to establish our authority in the region. The rich, untapped mineral wealth of northern Siberia will no doubt aid us on our journey to national unification."
            russia.121.a: "Another one of Mother Russia's children return to her embrace."
        russia.100.t: "Distant Dreamers"
            russia.100.d: "The Far Eastern Republic emerges as a beacon of liberal ideas in Siberia"
            russia.100.f: "The years since the collapse of the Russian Empire have been chaotic, to say the least. Yet even in the furthest reaches of Siberia, wild new ideas of governance have been spreading, particularly from the Fengtian republic to the south. In an era where absolute monarchies rule much of the world, this insignificant corner of Siberia offers a bold vision for a united future."
            russia.100.a: "Nonetheless, we have years of work ahead of us."

        IRK_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Kingdom of Irkutsk, a miniscule slice of Siberia, is in fact of utmost importance to the future of the Russian nation. Tsar Yeltsin, the last living Romanov (as he has asserted several times in the past), is the sole hope of the restoration of the old dynasty following the mysterious death of his entire family. Ruling from the icy domain of Irkutsk, the true Tsar (he is in fact a Romanov) now leads his forces boldly surrounded by enemies of the crown, who have clearly given up on the idea of a strong, united Russia in all but name (why else would they oppose an obviously Romanov ruler?). One day, however, all of Siberia and the western lands too will belong to a legitimate Tsar once more (how convenient that there is only one to choose from)."

In the end, who cared about unification or whatever? Tsar Yeltsin was much more engrossed with a slightly different matter: the mineral map above his desk, dotted with red and blue pins marking all the known deposits across his icy realm. He chuckled and exhaled, puffs of smoke lazily drifting away into faint rings.\nForeigners would pay good money for the rights to those mines, although of course competitive pricing was necessary to attract investments. And once that was over with, then it was a trivial matter to achieve what he had been dreaming of for years: to become the richest man in the world.\n Yeltsin took another puff from his cigar. Tomorrow, he would meet with the first group of investors, from Germany, as he had been told."

            russia.501.f: "Whatever the Siberian Free Territory had planned to put up in resistance had not materialized, given the ease with which Irkutsk troops secured the region. Shortly behind them were the surveying teams, with whom Tsar Yeltsin traveled to the northern wastes in search for the most valuable treasures in this vast land.\nThe geologists took measurements as Yeltsin shivered in his thick coat, partly from the cold but mostly from raw, undiluted anticipation. The land that stretched flatly to the horizon seemed to morph in his eyes into gleaming piles of gold, and he salivated in spite of himself. It froze on his chin.\n"You'd like for me to, uh, wipe that off for you, Tsar?" one of the geologists asked, setting his pencil down on the map spread haphzardly across the tarp they'd laid down.\n"No, I'm fine," Yeltsin replied, returning to his gold-laced dreams."

            russia.502.f: "The Kingdom of Irkutsk, one of the myriad Siberian states, has presented us with an opportunity: to provide them with military support in exchange for ownership of natural resources upon their unification of all Russia. While it is not unlikely that they will eventually fall, the rich deposits of Siberia are quite a tantalizing prospect, especially given the political influence over the weak-willed Yeltsin's state this will inevitably grant us."

He could see faint reflections on the window in front of him: several men, all armed.\n"Who dares disturb the Tsar in his work?" he asked, failing to keep a tremor from leaking into his voice.\nA laugh. "The Tsar? You're nothing but an old, lying piece of trash." The click of a rifle.\nYeltsin wiped his brow, running thick with perspiration. "As the last heir of the Romanov family--"\n"The same Romanovs you hired cronies to kill and dump in a lake?"\nYeltsin slumped in his chair. Damnit! He'd come so close. If he had just been a little bit more careful he'd be on a boat to Britannia or somewhere else to live a life of luxury. He berated himself for such simple mistakes as the rifles poked at his head and his hands were roughly bound behind him as he was yanked out of his leather chair.\nMaybe next time, fate would be less cruel to him."
